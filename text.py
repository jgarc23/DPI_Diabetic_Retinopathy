                ***Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication affecting the eyes. 
                High blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading 
                to vision problems. It can occur in anyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes 
                and can result in blindness if untreated. Diabetic retinopathy can lead to 
                vision loss if not detected early. Regular eye exams and good control of 
                blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol are essential in preventing 
                and managing this condition.***

                Blood Vessels: In the eye, blood vessels are critical for supplying the retina 
                with oxygen and nutrients. 

                Microaneurysms: Small bulges in the blood vessels of the retina, 
                caused by weakened capillary walls, and are an early sign of diabetic retinopathy.

                Hard Exudates: Yellowish deposits of lipids and proteins that leak 
                from damaged blood vessels in the retina, often seen in diabetic retinopathy.

                Soft Exudates: Also known as cotton wool spots, are fluffy white patches 
                on the retina caused by nerve fiber swelling due to inadequate blood supply.
                
                Optical Disk: The optic disc is where the optic nerve fibers exit the retina, 
                appearing as a small, round, pale area. It transmits visual information from 
                the retina to the brain.
